# Plesk Extension Virtuozzo EZ-templates
This script was created to allow for faster builds of Virtuozzo EZ-templates for Plesk Extensions.
This is version 1.0 of the script and while it build for CentOS, I have to clean up the other OS release versions in the case fields to make it fully compatible with all that Virtuozzo has to offer.
